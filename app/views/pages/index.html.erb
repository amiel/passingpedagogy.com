Passing Curriculum

In all of these exercises: the teacher crosses, and the student passes straight. At each step, especially the first, give feedback on passes, focussing on what works, and one thing to change to improve that throw. If passes get rough, go back to the previous exercise to solidify muscle memory.

In general, if a step is difficult for the student, you can just work on one side for a while, but don't move on I the next step until both sides are proficient.

Exercise 1: 3 club ultimates. Lofty singles, just throw to the empty hand. Only one throw at a time. This one is to learn the basic pass with each hand.

Exercise 1b: 3 clubs, student starts with two, teach throws first pass, student learns to react with a pass. This exercise is mostly about timing, and continuing to throw good passes while having another club come in.

Exercise 2: 4 clubs. This is the first 4 throws of 5 ultimates; this is easier than 5 club ultimates because there is a pause. One club starts in each hand. There are four possible starts (one from each hand), and I find that because it can be confusing to switch between then, this exercise works well focusing on each start at a time. Begin with the student starting, and have them switch to the other side as soon as they feel comfortable with the first. Instruct them to start on either side until they are comfortable with both. (note: as the teacher, reacting to either side in this exercise can be mildly confusing at first. It's not hard, just make sure to try it a few times so you know what's up)

Exercise 2b: same as before, but now with the teacher starting. Stick to one side at a time, and let the student know before switching. Move on when you can consistently catch all four throws from both sides. Review exercise 1b if you think it might be helpful.

Exercise 2c: 4 clubs, same pattern, always start with the same club. This basically cycles through all four starts.

Exercise 3: 5 club ultimates. This is passing!
