    In all of these exercises: the teacher crosses, and the student passes straight (the animations are from the teachers point of view).
  </p>
  <p>
    At each step, especially the first, give feedback on passes, focussing on what works, and one thing to change to improve that throw. If passes get rough, go back to the previous exercise to solidify muscle memory.

    In general, if a step is difficult for the student, you can just work on one side for a while, but don't move on to the next step until both sides are proficient.
